# ToDo-list

## Description

This is a simple and responsive ToDo List web application built using HTML, CSS (SCSS), and TypeScript. The application allows users to add tasks, fetch tasks from an API, and delete tasks. Tasks can be categorized as either manual or fetched from an API, and the application keeps track of the number of completed tasks.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can manually add tasks to the list.
- **Fetch Tasks:** Users can fetch a specified number of tasks from an external API.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete all tasks, only manual tasks, or only API-fetched tasks.
- **Task Completion Tracking:** The application displays the number of completed tasks.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is responsive and works well on various screen sizes.
- **Custom Elements:** The app is built using custom elements (`<todo-item>` and `<todo-list>`) for modularity and reusability.
- **CSS Flexbox:** Used for layout and alignment of elements in the UI.
- **SCSS:** Styles are written in SCSS for better modularity and maintainability.
